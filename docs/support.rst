Support
*******

If you're having trouble getting Pathomx doing what you want or you have an idea how it
can be improved, there are a number of ways you can get help.

BioStars & MetaStars
====================

Support is available on the `BioStars <http://biostars.org>`_ (bioinformatics) and `MetaStars <http://metastars.org>`_ (metabolomics)
Q&A sites. Post your question using the `pathomx` tag and it will be answered.

Mailing list
============

A low-traffic `mailing list`_ is available (hosted on Google Groups) for support and new release announcements.

Bugs, Issues & Suggestions
==========================

Pathomx is an open source application and uses `Github`_ (a developer community) to host the
source code and track `bugs`_ and `feature requests`_. If you have either just add it to the list
and we'll work with you to resolve it.

Twitter
=======

Releases and announcements are available via `@pathomx`_ on `twitter`_.

Email
=====

If you would like to get in touch directly, you can email `Martin Fitzpatrick`_ (Lead Developer) directly. 
Pathomx is currently a spare-time project, please bear with me.
