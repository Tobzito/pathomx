If you're having trouble getting Pathomx doing what you want or you have an idea how it
can be improved, there are a number of ways you can get help.

Bugs, Issues & Suggestions
==========================

Pathomx is an open source application and uses `Github`_ (a developer community) to host the
source code and track `bugs`_ and `feature requests`_. If you have either just add it to the list
and we'll work with you to resolve it.

Twitter
=======

Releases and announcements are available via `@pathomx`_ on `twitter`_.

Email
=======

If you would like to get in touch directly, you can email me [`Martin Fitzpatrick`_ (Lead Developer)] directly. 
Pathomx is a spare-time project and I may take a while to respond if busy elsehwere, please bear with me.
