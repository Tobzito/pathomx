Developer Installation
**********************

If you would like to help with Pathomx development you will need to install a source
version of the code. Note: This is not necessary if you just want to contribute plugins,
as these can be developed against the binary installation.

Getting Started
===============

The development code is hosted on `Github`_. To contribute to development you should first
create an account on Github (if you don't have one already), then fork the pathomx/pathomx
repo so you have a personal copy of the code. If you're not familiar with Github, there is a 
`useful guide`_ available here.

On your version of the repo (should be <username>/pathomx) you will see an url to clone
the repo to your desktop. Take this and then from the command line (in a folder where 
you want the code to live) enter::

    git clone <repository-url>

After a while you will get a folder named pathomx containing the code.

The following sections list platform-specific setup instructions required to make Pathomx
run. Follow the instructions from the section and then you should be ready to run from the
command line using::

    python -m pathomx.Pathomx


Windows
=======

Install Qt5_ (Qt5.2) for Windows. Make the decision at this point whether you're installing
64bit or 32bit and stick to it.

Install Python 2.7.6 Windows installer from the `Python download site`_.

You can get Windows binaries for all required Python libraries from `the Pythonlibs library`_. 
At a minimum you will need to install NumPy_, SciPy_, `Scikit-Learn`_, Matplotlib_. Make sure that the installed
binaries match the architecture (32bit/64bit) of the installed Python.

For NMR data processing, you will need to install NMRGlue_ binaries.

For the dynamic pathway drawing plugin MetaViz you will also need to install Graphviz_.

To run Pathomx from the command line, change to the cloned git folder and then enter::

    python -m pathomx.Pathomx


MacOS X
=======

The simplest approach to setting up a development environment is through the 
MacOS X package manager Homebrew_. It should be feasible to build all these tools from 
source, but I'd strongly suggest you save yourself the bother.

Install Homebrew as follows::

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

Once that is in place use brew install to install python, PyQt4 (which will 
automatically install Qt4) and graphviz. From the command line enter:

    brew install python pyqt graphviz 
    
You can opt to install pyqt5 instead, however currently this offers lower performance and requires
bleeding-edge matplotlib/IPython to function.
Next use pip to install Python packages numpy, scipy, pydot, nmrglue, gpml2svg, 
poster, wheezy, sklearn, icoshift, matplotlib. This can be done in a one liner with pip:

    pip install numpy scipy poster matplotlib scikit-learn dill
    pip install ipython[all]
    
You can also optionally install the following for some data analysis notebooks:

    pip install pydot nmrglue gpml2svg icoshift

That should be enough to get Pathomx up and running from the command line. For development a
useful tool to install is `Total Terminal`_, which gets you access to the command line
via a hotkey.

To run Pathomx from the command line, change to the cloned git folder and then enter::

    python -m pathomx.Pathomx


Linux
=====

The development version (available via git) supports Python 3 and so can now be run on
Linux (tested on Ubuntu Saucy Salamander). Note: Python 3 PyQt5 is only available from 13.10.
To install on earlier releases of Ubuntu you will need to install from source.

There are a number of packages that need to be installed first::

    sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5 python3-matplotlib python3-requests python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-yapsy

    pip3 install scikit-learn

Note that aside from python3-pyqt5 you can also install the other packages using pip3 (the names on PyPi are
the same as for the packages minus the python3- prefix). Once installation of the above has completed you're ready to go.

To run Pathomx from the command line, change to the cloned git folder and then enter::

    python -m pathomx.Pathomx
