1D Bruker NMR Analysis with Re-Export to Bruker format
******************************************************

Analysis of 1D Bruker NMR data files, including shifting, normalisation (PQN) and binning before
re-exporting as Bruker format 1D NMR files using the standard Pathomx toolkit. These files
can be reloaded into any normal NMR analysis software e.g. Chenomx.

You can download the `completed workflow`_ or follow the steps below to recreate it yourself.
This workflow is also distributed with the latest versions of Pathomx and can be found within
the software via *Help > Demos*.
