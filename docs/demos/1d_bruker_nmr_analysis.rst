1D Bruker NMR Analysis
**********************

Analysis of 1D Bruker NMR data files including alignment, Icoshift segmental alignment,
exclusion of regions, normalisation (PQN) and spectral binning. Data are subsequently
assigned experimental classes, then annotated using the MetaboHunter online 
NMR peak identification service, analysed using a simple PLS-DA and also exported
as a standard CSV format datafile for subsequent analysis.
