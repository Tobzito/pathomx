Demos & Sample Workflows
************************

This page lists a number of demo workflows that you can use to get acquainted with 
using Pathomx for analysis. Follow the links for both the completed workflow and 
a step-by-step guide to it's construction and then use.

If you have suggestions for new workflows or additions to the list open an `feature request`_
via Github.
