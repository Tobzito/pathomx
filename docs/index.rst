Workflows can be created, edited and shared using the 
built-in analysis workflow editor. Set up standardised analysis approaches and apply them 
to new data consistently. Add-remove tools to test different approaches, and re-apply 
tried and tested methods to new data. Use the built-in and custom tools to streamline your
data analysis workflow, improving throughput and reproducibility.
