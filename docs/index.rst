Workflow-based analysis allows the construction of reproducible and efficient analysis
of scientific data. Workflows can be re-arranged to test different approaches and saved to 
track the development of your approach. Saved workflows can also be shared with other users
or groups, allowing instant reproduction of results and methods. Tools can export images
as publication-ready high resolution images in common formats.

This documentation contains useful information, demos and tips for the use of Pathomx by
both users and developers.
