Getting Started
***************

This is quick start-up guide for new users of `Pathomx`_. In here you should find everything
you need to know to start using Pathomx right away. Once you've been through the basics
you might like to see some of the `demo workflows`_ to see what Pathomx is capable of.

Pathomx aims to offer a powerful, extensible analysis and processing platform while being
as simple to use as possible to the casual user. It should be possible to pick up Pathomx,
use the built-in - or bioinformatician provided - tools and perform a complete analysis
in a matter of minutes. Saved workflows should be simple to use, reliable and reproducible.
Outputs should be beautiful.

If Pathomx fails for you on any of those points, please do `file a bug report`_ and it'll 
be sorted out as soon as humanly possible.
