BML-NMR Quantified/Identified Data Import
=========================================

Import data from the BML-NMR 2D JRES NMR identification platform. [Martin A. Fitzpatrick][]

Introduction
------------

The Birmingham Metabolite Library is a collection of 3328 experimental 1D and 2D J-resolved NMR spectra of 208 metabolite standards. Established by [University of Birmingham][] researchers and funded by the [BBSRC][]

The BML contains raw data (FIDs), 1D and 2D spectra, and quantified peak lists, alongside metadata compliant with the Metabolomics Standards Initiative endorsed reporting requirements<sup>[1][]</sup>. All data in the library is made freely available to the scientific community. However, it requests that use of the library is acknowledged by reference to: [C. Ludwig, J.M. Easton, A. Lodi, S. Tiziani, S. Manzoor, A.D. Southam, J.J. Byrne, L.M. Bishop, S. He, T.N. Arvanitis, U.L. Günther, and M.R. Viant. Birmingham Metabolite Library: A publicly accessible database of 1-D <sup>1</sup>H and 2-D <sup>1</sup>H J-resolved NMR spectra of authentic metabolite standards (BML-NMR). *Metabolomics* 8(1), 8-18 (2012).][]

The library also forms the core of a data mining algorithm for the automated identification and quantification of metabolites in 2D J-resolved datasets available for registered users of the site

Quick start
-----------

J-resolved NMR spectra should be submitted to the BML-NMR for identification as described [here][]. Once the identification job has completed the resulting dataset can be downloaded from the site as a .zip file. To import the data into Pathomx simply load this zip file directly through this plugin. Metabolite names and quantities will be shown on the Table view.
