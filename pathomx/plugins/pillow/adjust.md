Introduction
------------
This tool performs basic image adjustments including brightness, contrast, color and sharpness. Add image data to 
the *input_image* input (e.g. via the Image import tool) then adjust the sliders to modify the image output. All
adjustments can be performed simultaneously. 

The adjusted image is available via the *output_image* output.
