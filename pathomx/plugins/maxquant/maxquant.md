Introduction
------------

[MaxQuant][] is a quantitative proteomics software package designed for analyzing large mass-spectrometric data sets.
It is specifically aimed at high-resolution MS data. Several labeling techniques as well as label-free quantification
are supported. MaxQuant is freely available and can be downloaded from [the website](MaxQuant). The download includes the search
engine Andromeda which is integrated into MaxQuant as well as the Viewer application for inspection of raw data and
identification and quantification results.

This tool is a first implementation of MaxQuant support, and imports labelled data only.
