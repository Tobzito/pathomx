Bruker Export
==========

Export NMR spectroscopy data to Bruker format.
[Martin A. Fitzpatrick][]

This plugin can take any spectra-like DataTable and export it as NMR spectra in the Bruker 
format. It currently requires an input dictionary of Bruker acquisition parameters (as output 
by the Bruker Import plugin) to write the neccessary files.

The resulting NMR output can be read by any standard NMR application such as Chenomx or TopSpin.
